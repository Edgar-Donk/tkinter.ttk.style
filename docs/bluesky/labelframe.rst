Piratz Label Frame
------------------

.. image:: ../figures/07piratz_labelframe.png
   :width: 94px
   :height: 137px
   :align: center

The labelframe was created, and labels were used to flesh out the frame. The 
labelframe required padding in the layout management to ensure that any 
widget placed inside the frame did not affect the frame and cleared the outer 
borders.
