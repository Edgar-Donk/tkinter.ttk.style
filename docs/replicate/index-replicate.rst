09 Replicating the Widgets
==========================

We are now in a position to replicate the widget images, as we have enough 
tools to draw most of the variations encountered.

We may be forced to create parts of the widget before or
after it has been reduced to the final size, dependant on the widget geometry 
and methods used in antialiasing.

.. topic:: Drawing at the Widget Size

   If we were to draw at the actual widget size we only need lines one pixel 
   wide and place pixels. However such an exercise would not help much in 
   creating widgets. In particular the corner construction, gradients and the 
   antialiasing would remain untested.
