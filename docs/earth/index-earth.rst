08 Down to Earth

As we have seen it is relatively simple to find an image then use this for a 
widget. What may be more difficult is to design a widget from scratch. Using 
an existing widget as a template, as we did in the previous chapter, we can 
alter its colours to produce similar looking widgets. Simple drawing tools 
such as PIL ImageDraw or tkinter Canvas are all we need since the widgets
are quite small. We are fortunate in that we can see what has already been 
achieved in ttktheme.
