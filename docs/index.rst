   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

=====================
Putting on the Style!
=====================

.. topic:: Purpose

   Ever wanted to give your application a more "professional" look, or just
   wanted to jazz up your widgets, well ever since Tkinter added their themed 
   module ttk you can do just that and quite easily too.

.. sidebar:: Advanced Programmers

   You will probably find that you only need to skim through the first three
   chapters - still it's probably best to check out the tables and run the 
   examples.

.. topic:: What to Expect

   A quick tour, with working examples, using the tkinter.ttk.Style class, so 
   that you should be able to test a widget and check its styling changes on 
   your own ideas and scripts. 

   An even more lightning tour through the themes from tkinter.ttk and 
   ttkthemes.

   Create a few specials to show what can be achieved then create a standalone 
   version, after that you are only limited by your imagination.
