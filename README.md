### tkinter.ttk.style

# Tkinter in Python - putting on the style!

As you are no doubt aware tkinter introduced a theme (or tile) based module. Searching the web I was struck by how little the
new capabilities were demonstrated, questions and answers concentrated mostly on how to colour widgets and suchlike.

## What to expect

A quick tour, with working examples, through the tkinter.ttk Style module, so that you should be able to test a widget and check 
its styling changes on your own ideas and scripts.  

An even more lightning tour through the themes from tkinter.ttk and ttkthemes.

Create a few specials to show what can be achieved then create a standalone version, after that you are only limited by your
imagination, where an appreciation of PIL (Pillow) will be useful.
